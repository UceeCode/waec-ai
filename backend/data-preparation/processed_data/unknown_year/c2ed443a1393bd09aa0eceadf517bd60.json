  "content": ":\n \n \nIn evolutionary biology, the term analogous structures pertain to\n \nthe various structures in different species having the same function\n \nbut have evolved separately, thus do not share common ancestor.\n \n \nIn comparison, the homologous structures pertain to the structures\n \nthat show similar morphology and anatomy but have different\n \nfunctions. Moreover, the homologous structures are believed to\n \nhave evolved from a common ancestor since they show similar\n \ndevelopment pattern during embryonic development.\n \n \nQuestion 2\n \n \nWhich of the following statements reflects the mechanism of\n \nnatural selection?\n \n \nOption\ns\n \n \nA) There are variations within every species",
