  "content": "Question 5\nWhat determines the polarity at the ends of an electromagnet? The\nOptions\nA) magnitude of the current passing through the wire\nB) material of the core of the magnet\nC) material of the coil\nD) direction of current in the wire\nThe correct answer is\u00a0D.\nQuestion 6\nHow many beta particle(s) are emitted in the radioactive decay of\u00a0 ?\nOptions\nA) 1\nB) 2\nC) 3\nD) 5\nThe correct answer is\u00a0A.\nExplanation:\nA beta particle forms when a neutron changes into a proton and a high-energy\nelectron. The proton stays in the nucleus but the electron leaves the atom as a beta\nparticle. When a nucleus emits a beta particle, these changes happen:\nthe mass number stays the same\nthe atomic number increases by 1\nthe nuclear charge increases by 1\nNB: Usually gold is created from platinum, which has one less proton than gold, or\nfrom mercury, which has one more proton than gold. Bombarding a platinum or\nmercury nucleus with neutrons can knock off an neutron or add on a neutron, which\n19879Au\u2190 19880 Hg",
