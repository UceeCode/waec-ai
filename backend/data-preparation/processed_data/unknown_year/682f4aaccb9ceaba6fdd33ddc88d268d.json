A zygote is a single\n \ncell, with a complete set of chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.\n \nThe egg cell, or ovum, is the female reproductive cell gamete in oogamous\n \norganisms. The egg cell is typically not capable of active movement, and it is much\n \nlarger (visible to the naked eye) than the motile sperm cells. When egg and sperm\n \nfuse, a diploid cell (the zygote) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism.\n \n \nQuestion\n \n8\n \n \nIf Amoeba is placed in a salt solution. the contractile vacuoles\n \nwould \n\u200b \nOptions\n \n \nA) be bursting more\n \nfrequently\n \n \nB) be more\n \nnumerous\n \n \nC) be formed less\n \nfrequently\n \n \nD) grow bigger before they\n \nburst",
