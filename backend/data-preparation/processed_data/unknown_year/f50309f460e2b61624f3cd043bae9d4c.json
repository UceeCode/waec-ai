  "content": "D) Root tip cell and guard\n \ncell\n \n \nThe correct answer is\n \nB.\n \n \nExplanation\n:\n \n \nA spermatozoon is a motile sperm cell, or moving form of the haploid\n \ncell that is the male gamete. A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a\n \nzygote. A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of\n \nchromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo.\n \n \nThe egg cell, or ovum, is the female reproductive cell gamete in\n \noogamous organisms. The egg cell is typically not capable of active\n \nmovement, and it is much larger (visible to the naked eye) than the\n \nmotile sperm cells. When egg and sperm fuse, a diploid cell (the\n \nzygote) is formed, which rapidly grows into a new organism.",
