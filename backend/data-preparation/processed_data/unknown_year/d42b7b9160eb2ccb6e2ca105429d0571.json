  "content": "In p-type semiconductors, holes are the majority carriers and electrons are the\nminority carriers. P-type semiconductors are created by doping an intrinsic\nsemiconductor with acceptor impurities. A common p-type dopant for silicon is boron\nor gallium.\nQuestion 9\nLet \u0394x be the uncertainty in the measurements of position and \u0394p the uncertainty in\nmeasurement of momentum. The uncertainty principle relation is given as\nOptions\nA) \u0394x . \u0394p = h\nB) \u0394x . \u0394p \u2264 h\nC) \u0394x . \u0394p \u2265h\nD) \u0394x . \u0394p > h\nThe correct answer is\u00a0C.\nExplanation:\nUncertainty principle, also called Heisenberg uncertainty principle or indeterminacy\nprinciple, statement, articulated (1927) by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg,\nthat the position and the velocity of an object cannot both be measured exactly, at\nthe same time, even in theory. The very concepts of exact position and exact\nvelocity together, in fact, have no meaning in nature.\nQuestion 10\nTwo objects of masses 80kg and 50kg are separated by a distance of 0.2m. If the\ngravitational constant is 6.6 x 10Nm kg, calculate the gravitational attraction between\nthem.\nOptions\nA) 4.9 \u00d7 10N\nB) 1.3 \u00d7 10N\nC) 6.6 \u00d7 10N\n-11\n-9\n-6\n-8\n6",
